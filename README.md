Dash App for Iris Dataset
The iris flower dataset consists of five measurments (plant species + lengths and widths of their sepals and petals) of 150 plants. If we represent the species categorical variable as color, we are left with four continuos variables to represent. We visualize these four variables using a scatter plot as follows:

1. The sepal width and length are represented as the x and y variables of the scatter plot
2. The petal length corresponds to the size of the markers
3. The petal width information can be obtained by hovering over each of the markers

Finally, a range slider restricts the markes displayed in the scatter to those whose petal widths are in the specified range.
